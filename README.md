## **SUMMARY** 
**One Piece** *is the name the world gave to all the treasure gained by the Pirate King Gol D. Roger. At least a portion of it once belonged to Joy Boy during the Void Century. The treasure is said to be of unimaginable value, and is currently located on the final island of the Grand Line: Laugh Tale.*

*The One Piece is the driving goal of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, as well as that of multiple other pirates, who all seek to claim the treasure in order to become the next Pirate King, following Roger's dying words at his execution.*

## **TRIVIA**
- **Eiichiro Oda** *himself confirmed in an interview with Momoko Sakura that the One Piece is not something like "the journey itself was the real treasure" and that it is, in fact, a physical reward.*

- *Whitebeard stated in his final words that the world will be "shaken to its core" when the One Piece is found.*

- *Donquixote Doflamingo made a similar statement about the national treasure of Mary Geoise*.
